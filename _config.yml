  Welcome to Dublin-Powell Church of Christ! We are striving to be the kind of Church described in the New Testament â€“ a Church with heart-felt worship, Bible based teaching, love for each other, congregational singing, prayer, and compassionate care for all who are in need.
  "And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father."
  Colossians 3:17
